# 🛠️🛍 Shopify Admin MCP Server (35 tools)

This project is a Claude-powered developer copilot tailored for Shopify merchants. It replicates and **extends** Shopify Sidekick with powerful multi-app integrations — Shopify Admin, Google Calendar, and Airtable — all wired through a Model Control Protocol (MCP) server.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone [this repo url]
cd shopify_admin_mcp
```

### 2. Configure Your Shopify Admin

Open `utils/shopify_client.py` and set your credentials:

```python
SHOPIFY_STORE = "your-store-id.myshopify.com"
SHOPIFY_TOKEN = "your-admin-access-token"
API_VERSION = "2025-07"
```

### 3. Connect the Server to Claude Desktop

In your Claude Desktop `config.json`, add the following entry:

```json
"shopify_anidev": {
  "command": "uv",
  "args": [
    "--directory",
    "your-cloned-git-repo-path-in-files",
    "run",
    "server.py"
  ]
}
```

Make sure Claude Desktop has file access to this path.

### 4. Run the MCP Server

From the project root:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

Claude will now be able to call any of the above tools as an autonomous Shopify assistant.
